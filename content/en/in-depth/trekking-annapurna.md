### **Get prepared for the Annapurna Circuit Trek**

After having shared our [trekking in the Kathmandu Valley]({{< ref "trekking-kathmandu.md" >}}), it's definitely worth telling you about our trekking route on the **Annapurna Circuit Trek**. More in details, we've been through a ring trail that has brought us on a natural balcony to see the Annapurna chain in its whole: **Poon Hill**.

We've been on a 4 days trek as follows:

 - **Day 1**: [From Nayapul to Ulleri](#nayapul-ulleri)
 - **Day 2**: [From Ulleri to Ghorepani](#ulleri-ghorepani)
 - **Day 3**: [From Ghorepani to Ghandruk](#ghorepani-ghandruk)
 - **Day 4**: [From Ghandruk to Nayapul](#ghandruk-nayapul)

Differently from trekking around the **Kathmandu** Valley, to trek this trait on the Himalayas you'll need both the **TIMS card** and **ACAP**. If you don't know what I'm talking about, read [this]({{< ref "tips.md#Trekking-1" >}}).

We decided not to hire a guide nor a [porter]({{< ref "tips.md#Trekking-9" >}}), and so we've been traveling solo (well, the two of us).

----------

### **How to get to Nayapul**

To get to **Nayapul** you have to get to **Pokhara** first. Local buses are not recommended for a long ride from Kathmandu, but we do suggest to book a seat on a private company's bus instead (such as Greenline) like we did. To know more about the differences between all the available bus options, have a look [here]({{< ref "tips.md#Transport-5" >}}).

Departing from Pokhara, you can decide whether to take a taxi (~1,200NPR), a jeep (~4,500-6,500NPR) or a bus to get to **Nayapul**. We choose the latter option and have taken a bus at the **Baglung Bus Park**. Be careful cause this station is not so close to **Pokhara lakeside** (which is the heart of the city). You can walk to get to the Bus Park but make sure it won't take you too long. Buses depart in the morning following a timetable, at least they should. However, there are several departures starting at early morning til midday so you won't risk to miss your ride.

Nayapul is around **40km/25mi** far from Pokhara, so it would take you **2h** more or less to get there by bus.
This ride is **200NPR**.

----------

### **Day 1: Trekking from Nayapul to Ulleri** ### {#nayapul-ulleri}

You'll have around **10km/6mi** in front of you for this very first day onto the **Annapurna Circuit Trek**. The initial part will be the easiest, while the last mile will be really hard.
Anyway, first things first: your bus ride will lead you to **Nayapul**, which is basically an open-air bazaar.

{{< bundle-image name="trekking-annapurna-nayapul." alt="trekking-annapurna-nayapul" caption="Nayapul is the starting point to trek the Annapurna" >}}

Just keep following the only roadway towards **Birethanti** when you'll have to stop at a **TIMS checkpoint**. Then pass through the bridge and you'll find another checkpoint (the **ACAP** one) on the left. While the first one is mandatory (guards would shout at you if you'd try to pass by without doing that stop), we're not sure about the latter. However, we did stop there too to get our ACAP doc signed and we also gained some useeful info on the Annapurna Circuit trek conditions from the guy who was checking permits.

{{< bundle-image name="trekking-annapurna-conservation-area" alt="trekking-annapurna-conservation-area" caption="Annapurna Conservation Area entry signal" >}}

Here after, you will walk peacefully until reaching **Hile**, a small village where we do suggest to stop to have something to eat. At this point, you should've walked for around **8km/5mi** with an elevation gain of **500m/1,700ft**.

Now, the hardest part.
Only **2km/1.3mi** will be missing til entering **Ulleri**, but you'll need to gain another 500m/1,700ft in elevation within this very last trait only. This high slope is all made of steps (more that 3,000 actually), so that you will hate stairs and the end of your journey! Luckily, this is the first day on track, so you're still fresh and energized.

**Ulleri** is located at **2.090m/6,800ft**. Find a place to rest, have dinner and spend the night in this village. Price for a double room is usually 300NPR, but don't hold back from negotiation (we got a **double room for 200NPR** only).

{{< bundle-image name="trekking-annapurna-ulleri" alt="trekking-annapurna-ulleri" caption="Trekking sull'Annapurna, giorno 1: l'ultima scalinata verso Ulleri" >}}

**Duration**: ~ 4h

**Distance**: ~ 10km/6mi

**Accomodation**: Kamala Guest House

----------

### **Day 2: Trekking from Ulleri to Ghorepani** ### {#ulleri-ghorepani}

Day two is all uphill, but shorter and easier than day one of this trekking on the Annapurna. This day trail is a **8km/5mi** one, a basic mountain track Nepalese style, with plenty of villages, little rivers and waterfalls. You can take it slowly, meaning you can get on track later in the morning and enjoy the views. People traveling with a [guide]({{< ref "tips.md#Trekking-8" >}}) usually depart early in the morning (around 8-8:30am), so if you're traveling solo we do suggest to depart an hour later than them or so, so that your track will be free from crowds.

Once arrived in **Ghorepani** you can choose whether to:

+ go up to **Poon Hill** to see the sun go down behind the **Annapurna** mountain chain. In this case, you'd have to add around **1h** to your daily track just to get to **Poon Hill**'s view point.
+ find a place to spend the night by asking for an available room at some lodge and trek to **Poon Hill** the day after, to see the **sunrise**
+ do both :)

We decided to climb up to **Poon Hill** the day after our arrival in **Ghorepani** to see the sunrise, even because the sky was not so clear that afternoon at our arrival.

{{< bundle-image name="trekking-annapurna-ghorepani" alt="trekking-annapurna-ghorepani" caption="Ghorepani entrance on the Annapurna Circuit Trek" >}}

**Duration**: ~ 4h

**Distance**: ~ 8km/6mi

**Accomodation**: Nice View Point Lodge

----------

### **Day 3: Trekking from Ghorepani to Ghandruk** ### {#ghorepani-ghandruk}

Having decide to get to **Poon Hill at sunrise**, we had to wake up very early. Based on the season, get informed on when the sun would rise, or ask for the right time to someone in your lodge the night before. Other trekkers are always happy to share their expertise! Once you know when the sun will rise, plan your early departure accordingly.

Also, note that reaching **Poon Hill at sunrise** means having to pay a **100NPR** entrance fee, whilst entrance is free at sunsets and during the rest of the day.
If you'd decide to go there to see the sunrise, bring a front light with you cause of course it will be dark still. 
This track at sunrise is really crowded, but we've been there in late December and we must tell that we were expecting more people on our same path. So we have to admit we've been quite lucky. Of course, there's plenty of people at the very top but we saw scary pictures of Poon Hill's balcony when still planning our trek, so finding that place way less busy than we thought has been a positive surprise.

**Poon Hill's view point** is at **3,200m/10,500ft** and gives you an unbelievable open view on the whole **Annapurna** mountain chain.
There's no chance for us to be able to describe it. We're simply speechless in front of the nature majesty.

{{< bundle-image name="trekking-poon-hill" alt="trekking-poon-hill" caption="Poon Hill. A natural balcony on the Annapurna" >}}

From there, you'll see **NILGIRI SOUTH**(6,839m), **ANNAPURNA SOUTH**(7,219m), **BARAHA SIKHAR** (7,647m), **HIUNCHULI**(6,441m), **MACHHAPUCHHRE**(6,993m).
The latter is the most known one, famous as **fishtail** due to its summit's shape. It's a sacral mountain, so the Nepalese Government gives no permits to trekkers to officially go on a hike there.

Now, go back to **Ghorepani**, pack your backpacks and go back on track towards **Tadapani**, not before having had a rich breakfast at your lodge's.
You'll have to deal with a gentle rise until you'll reach the **Deurali Pass**, then you'd start downhill.
We've been there in winter, so this section of the trail was covered of ice and snow. We were wearing [proper trekking shoes]({{< ref "tips.md#Trekking-6" >}}) so it's not been a big deal for the two of us, even though we definitely had to pay the max attention. However, it might be useful if you bring hicking sticks and/or removable spikes for ice, especially if you're not expert trekkers.

Our original plan was to stop in **Tadapani** for that night, but we were feeling good and it was not late afternoon yet, so we decided to move forward into the wild and get to **Ghandruk** on that same day. Tadapani-Gandruk is an easy track and you'll be surrounded by woods and trees; in my humble opinion, it is worth it not to stop in Tadapani and to continue towards Ghandruk. Walking peacefully in total silence, we've been lucky enough to see wild **white monkeys** on the trees right after leaving Tadapani!

Ghandruk is a quite large village, even though many houses and lodges are still under construction: it is clear how this area has suffered damage after the major **earthquake** that hit Nepal back in 2015.

**Duration**: ~ 7h

**Distance**: ~ 16km/10mi

**Accomodation**: Ghandruk Village Eco Lodge


----------

### **Day 4: Trekking from Ghandruk to Nayapul** ### {#ghandruk-nayapul}

This last day of trekking the Annapurna circuit trek is not an hard one, indeed it's basically all downhill so you don't need such muscles (but solid knees though!).
Many people end this ring in **Kimche** where it is possible to take a bus or a jeep and get to **Nayapul**, but we wanted to close our ring on our own feet.

While walking this last part of our trekking route it's when we've met children the most, begging us for [candies]({{< ref "tips.md#General-20" >}}).

Enjoy this easy track back to the starting point, when you'd have to check out in **Birethanti**, at the **TIMS** chekpoint, to register you exit from the Annapurna Conservation Area. From there, just walk to get to the same point where your trekking route has started at the bus stop, and wait for your bus to **Pokhara**. Buses usually depart every 15/30 minutes; during that waiting time you'll probably be stressed by someone who'd like you to choose their taxi instead of the bus, and pay them to directly take you to Pokhara.

**Duration**: ~ 4h 

**Distance**: ~ 12km/7.5mi

**Accomodation**: took a bus to get back to Pokhara

### **GPS track**

This is the GPS track that we designed and traveled:
