    description: There are 3 main categories for buses. <br>1) <b>Local buses</b> - the more real ones, always overcrowded; <br>2) <b>Tourist buses</b> - do not get that 'tourist' wrong, there's nothing comfortable there. They run longer distances; <br>3) <b>Private companies buses</b> - very much suggested when going from a region to another.

    description: Greenline is the most known private bus company especially for the Kathmandu-Pokhara trait. This trip costs $50pp a/r. It takes 7 to 8 hours to get from Katmandu to Pokhara (or vice versa) but they stop in a clean place for lunch (included in the price).

    description: Every bus has its boss. These guys act as PR, space managers, cash counters and God only knows what else. They will come to you asking for payment and they will also decide where you have to sit or stand on the bus.

    description: As a tourist, you will probably being charged for double the price local people pay for a ride. It's something annoying, but prices are very low and 'bus bosses' are usually not the type of person you would like to argue with, so that's fine.

    description: If you're traveling with your backpack, remember to protect it with the rain cover before getting on the bus. If there won't be enough space for both you and your backpack onboard, it will be either underneath the bus or outside on its ceiling. Both are not-so-clean options.
