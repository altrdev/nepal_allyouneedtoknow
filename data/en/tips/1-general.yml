    description: Most people suggest to use Maps.me as an offline map. We have found it useful for moving around cities but Osmand is much better for trekking routes.

    description: Don't trust prices on booking.com. When in Nepal you will probably be charged more than expected. That's why it might be worth it not to book in advance and find a room directly on site.

    description: If you decide not to request your Visa online, you'll be asked to go through a quite long process at your arrival.<br>1) Grab you patience and go in line to request your Visa filling a form in at the automathic machines scattered around the immigration area. <b>This can be skipped by doing the online process</b>.<br>2) Go in line for paying for your Visa. Remember cash are highly recommended.<br>3) Go in the last line for the ultimate check and to get the stamp in your passport. If everything's fine, congrats! You're now in the country and one step closer to reach the Nirvana.

    description: Nepal and India have their own plug type, so EU or US ones might not work. <a href="https://amzn.to/2vTSxfv" target="_blank">This</a> is what you might need. However, despite not having these proper electric plugs we did make it with IT and 'shuko' ones. So traveling with something like <a href="https://amzn.to/2SsnpLG" target="_blank">this</a> could be enough for you too.
